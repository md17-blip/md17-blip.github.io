  <p> <a href="main.html">Your hair is just like oh my god. Like for real its amazing. I remember that one snap you sent me before we were dating and I was just admiring your dark hair over and over again. When it was straightened the first time we hung out that was like amazing. Like sincerely, dark or light, curled, normal, straight, short or long its like the most amazing crown ever.</a></p>
