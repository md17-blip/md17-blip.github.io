  <p id="big-paragraph">
<a href="hair.html">A dark gold curtain sprouts from your head <br>  
My queen’s crown, a sight I will never dread <br>
Fine strands falling with elegance <br>
Some lighter than the rest, beauty equivalent </a>
<br><br>
I enjoy to kiss up above <br>
On your forehead where I show my love <br>
An affectionate spot closest to your mind <br>
Thoughts of each other in which we bind <br><br>

Your expressive brows, a sight to behold <br>
Dark and compelling you must be told <br>  
The forms they take so emotional and strong <br> 
Like dancers along with a sharp song <br><br>

Fluttering lashes match your pupils <br> 
Moreover the lids match your irises <br> 
Perfect compliments hand in hand <br> 
Another spectacle that makes my heart expand <br><br> 

When the rays of sunlight kiss your face <br> 
The shine brings honey-brown eyes, full of grace <br> 
A pool of sparkles look at me <br> 
And my heart melts endlessly <br><br> 

Your little nose a gorgeous addition <br> 
With all other facial features a flawless coalition <br>  
“I got your nose” is a true statement <br> 
As you are mine and everything present <br><br>

Your beauties on the sides of your head <br>
Listening to every annoying thing that I have said<br>  
I hope that one day you’ll hear from me<br> 
“Darling will you marry me” in full sincerity<br><br> 

The pink and brown contrast puts me in a hex<br> 
One for which I am dazedly perplexed<br>  
For how can lips be that remarkable<br>  
Oh your beauty being matched is impossible<br><br>   

Two rows of sparkling pristine<br>  
I love it when they smile back at me<br> 
Those whiter spots that lie in the front<br>  
For them to stay I really want<br><br>  

Long and loving lies inside<br>  
Any lick I am so inclined<br>  
A compliment to my very own<br>  
There will never be a day it makes me groan<br><br>

Your necks a spot that’s fun to kiss<br>  
The action instantly fills you with such bliss<br>  
The bridge between your head and shoulders<br> 
Any connection with her makes you fold right over<br><br> 

The spot on your arm, a dark complexion<br>  
One for which I hold much affection<br>    
Though an unfortunate event of acquirement<br> 
Tis a stunning feature, never an impairment<br><br> 

Your soft hands fine and delicate <br>
Held in mine we truly do connect <br>
When they touch me a feeling sublime <br>  
A gift from heaven every time <br><br> 

Ten Fingers slender and caring <br>  
Gripping my body wherever you’re desiring <br>  
Although one on the left is missing something <br>
Perchance one day it’ll be a diamond ring <br><br> 

I love to drift off on your chest <br> 
The most divine breasts that you possess <br> 
All mine for you to show and give <br> 
My pair for as long as I live <br><br> 

Something about it just makes me whole <br> 
The stomach of a goddess whom I pulled <br>
Radiant in all its attributes <br> 
Any negativity about, I will refute <br><br> 

Your curves so fine and mesmerizing <br> 
I watch your hips as if I’m stargazing <br>
My hands grasp wonderfully on your sides <br>
A perfect place to hold my girl wherever she resides <br><br>

Your lips again, similar but a wider variety of colors <br>
It is one of my biggest pleasures to smother <br>
A gift from whatever created perfection <br>
I’m honored to be the one who gives her all affection <br><br> 

The other side exhibits rolling hills <br> 
With movement that brings me a thrill <br>
Rich in my favorite type of meat <br> 
For a view of them I would always plead <br><br> 

Light brush strokes on your flesh <br> 
These stretch marks always make me blush <br> 
Prominent on your delicious curves <br> 
The absence of them would truly hurt <br><br> 

The much darker area down below <br>
Does nothing but make me grow <br> 
A breathtaking heavenly trait <br>
Just one that I greatly appreciate <br><br>

Long and fine are your legs <br>
I wouldn’t consider trading them for another set <br>
I adore every part in full length <br> 
Especially when resting, me beneath <br><br> 

For a while you kept your feet hidden from me <br> 
But all they do is add to your majestic pedigree <br> 
The scar on your heel a sensitive intricacy <br> 
For our time I’ll handle her with my utmost gentility <br><br>  

Your skin a vast expanse of light-brown blaze <br> 
An alluring empire to my gaze <br> 
A silken-warm home to my touch <br> 
Oh I am obsessed very much <br><br> 

My home where I desire to be held <br>
Your arms, the only place I’m fully sheltered <br> 
Wrapped around emanating serenity <br> 
My haven, an always present retreat for me <br><br> 

You in mine all the same <br> 
Your weight on my chest keeps me tame <br>
Us both drift to slumber all so quick <br> 
Together as one, forever we’ll click <br><br> 

Our kisses the sweetest and most tender <br>
I know that our desiring passion will never end <br> 
Euphoria strikes when our lips meet <br> 
From you I’ll never dare retreat <br><br> 

The sounds you make delight my ears <br> 
Your voice will fuel my joy for years <br> 
An angelic laughter adds even more divinity <br> 
To not hear it would make hearing a nullity <br><br>

Your loving heart of the purest gold <br> 
Full of the people whom you hold <br> 
Putting them first above yourself <br> 
Your love superior to all other wealth <br><br> 

Your brain a vessel of eternal Intellect <br> 
Full of wisdom with you I hope to collect <br> 
I know your path will be long and success-filled <br>
As you have the power over the life you’ll build <br><br>

Your smile is a generator for my soul <br> 
It will never fail to make me feel full <br>
The ultimate sight, a symbol of success <br>
In finding my love, she who is the best <br><br>

Your scent brings me constant merriment <br> 
Reminding me of when our lips first met <br> 
Drawing and pulling me in with glee <br> 
I hope your essence will always surround me <br><br> 

Your diamonds upper and lower <br>
Strike my admiration with so much power <br>
Your a royal jewel in the flesh you see <br> 
Full of more gems then just the three <br><br>

The jokes you tell, light, sometimes wild <br> 
Make me feel as if I am still a child <br> 
Though I know of us who is more funny <br>
I won’t spoil your humor honey <br><br> 

When you sleep so often as you do <br> 
I get the chance to truly admire you <br> 
Even in slumber, so calm and graceful <br> 
My princess at rest still making my heart whole <br><br> 

Such elegance in everything you wear <br>
Not because the material, rather you, true and fair <br>  
Your jewelry and dresses my eyes love to follow <br> 
But even without, always my supermodel <br><br> 

To receive your touch, every time with such care <br> 
A privilege of which nothing else compares <br> 
I am more than the luckiest being alive <br> 
For your touch is what allows me to thrive <br><br> 

The energy that emanates from your soul <br>
So unique, it’s brilliance will never bore <br> 
Explorative, adventurous, and curious <br> 
I love being together when it’s even mischievous <br><br> 

Your knowledge so informed and vast <br> 
I gain so much in your brains grasp <br>
For with you every day I become improved <br>   
All thanks to your wisdom I absorb <br><br>  

My need for you is like water, essential <br>
Without you my state will be terrible <br>  
But my need for you is unlike water, don’t yet frown <br> 
For no matter how much of you I get, I’ll never drown <br><br>

And I know your need for me is all alike <br>
When apart our hearts will be so tight <br> 
Maybe a poor factor of our traveling experiences <br> 
But a factor I’ll never dare diminish <br><br>  

Your own hopes and dreams motivate me <br>
For I want to be successful by the side of my deity <br>
Accomplishing our goals together will be everything <br>   
Without a doubt, the best life worth living <br><br> 

Your life so far has been so full <br>
My warrior, the strongest I know <br>  
I truly hope for you I make everything worthwhile <br> 
For you deserve the world, to unrestrictedly smile <br><br>

I can never get enough of you my girl <br>  
My heart you will never fill, but always fill <br> 
Oh my love is all for you baby <br>
If not thou then absolutely nobody <br><br> 

Euphoria every time when our bodies combine <br> 
A connection nothing short of divine <br> 
The closest ever, me in you, you around me <br> 
Our pure love in full physicality <br><br> 

Oh one day you will be my wife <br>
Now and then on you’ll be my life <br> 
Even at death we will never part <br> 
My love you rule my heart
